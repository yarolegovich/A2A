# Agent2Agent Protocol (A2A)

An open protocol enabling Agent-to-Agent interoperability, bridging the gap
between opaque agentic systems.

## Key Principles

Using A2A, agents accomplish tasks for end users without sharing memory,
thoughts, or tools. Instead the agents exchange context, status, instructions,
and data in their native modalities.

- **Simple**: Reuse existing standards
- **Enterprise Ready**: Auth, Security, Privacy, Tracing, Monitoring
- **Async First**: (Very) Long running-tasks and human-in-the-loop
- **Modality Agnostic**: text, audio/video, forms, iframe, etc.
- **Opaque Execution**: Agents do not have to share thoughts, plans, or tools.
